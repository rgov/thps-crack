# Metal-Accelerated Cheat Code Cracker for *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2/3*

Bo Bayles [reverse-engineered *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2*][bbayles] to understand how the game recognizes cheat codes on PlayStation and Dreamcast consoles.

In brief, while the game is paused and the player is holding down <kbd>L1</kbd>, each additional button press updates two 32-bit hashes. If the hashes match one of the expected values for the cheat codes, the game activates the corresponding cheat.

For example, in *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2*, to enable "mirror mode", the hashes must equal `0xA3E2DCE2` and `0x7A6115CE` respectively. These values are generated by the button sequence <kbd>↑ ↓ ← → Y A X B ↑ ↓ ← → Y A X B</kbd> on Dreamcast.

Bo discovered hash values for several previously-unknown cheat codes in *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2* and *3*. The challenge is figuring out what button combinations would generate these specific hash values.

This repo contains a GPU-accelerated brute force program to try to uncover the remaining codes. The program uses Apple's Metal API and can be run on a Mac:

    $ make
    $ time ./thpscrack 10 A3E2DCE2 7A6115CE
    ...
    Found solution: UDLRTXSCUDLRTXSC
    Target hashes: 0xA3E2DCE2 0x7A6115CE

The first argument is maximum sequence length. The output uses PlayStation nomenclature, T for Triangle and so on.

On a MacBook Pro with M1 Max it can search all 628.3 billion sequences of 1 to 13 buttons in about 2 minutes.

The code was written through a back and forth with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
